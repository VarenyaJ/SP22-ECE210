F(w)*H(w) = Y(w)
    LTI systems can only "destroy" frequencies, never create new frequencies
    LTI systems can have 2 different frequency inputs (A and B), but only 1 frequency in the output (A)
        because you must have H(B) = 0

Categorize filters by
    amplitude-frequency graphs
    phase-frequency graphs ?
    |H(ω|
    <H(ω∞)
    limit at inifnity
    add pi in Q2, subrtact pi in Q3 bc of angle of complex num = Im/Re, yet Q1 and Q4 don't need a phase change
        H(ω) = sqrt(H(ω) * conjugateH(ω))
        <H(ω) = arctan[ (Im(H(ω))) / (Re(H(ω∞))) ]

Steps to find a filter
    scaling input
    evaluate |H(ω)| at 0, ∞, and in between

Conceptual Example
    Linear system has freq. response:
        H(ω) = e ^jω
        input : x(t) = 3sin(3t -3) +3

            x(t) = 3cos(3t - 3 - π/2) + 3cos(0)
                H(ω) = 3e ^[-j(3 + π/2)]  + 3e ^j0
    different frequencies on inputs must be treated differently with ???

remember d/dt = jω

ex. ???
    y(t) + d/dt ^5 (y) + d/dt ^2 (f) = f(t) - dy/dt

    y + (jw)^5 * y + (jw)^2 * f = f - jwy
    y + w^5 * yj - w^2 * f = f * jwy
    y(q + jw^5 + jw) = f(1+ w^2)
    H(w) = Y/F = [(1 + jw^5 + jw) / (1 + w^2)] ^ -1 

sine & cosine identities expressed with oiler's number

how to tell is a system and/or input is periodic

complex exponentials are periodic, but purely real exponentials are not periodic

lowercase letters are in time-domain, uppercase letters are in frequency-domain

For fourier series
    F0 is the average of the function
    Gibbs Phenomenon
    discontinuities
    convergence
    divergence
    conditions for existence and usage: MUST HAVE ALL THREE
        f(t) must be periodic and absolutly integrable
            absolutly integrable???
    must be a finite number of maxes and mins over one period, and a finite number of finite discontinuities over one period 

phasor only has one frequency, exponentials can have many ???

fourier series input, linear system: system output?

skip t=0 in integration of fourier series because things get weird at 0?

What frequncies you have?
What frequencies will survive the filter?
What frequencies will be in your final answer?

Fn -> Yn
    Fourier coefficients

Y(t) is steady-state solution, not the transient
    Dissipative systems have elements that die out, but periodic systems cannot have terms which decay
    So these LTI systems which we consider Dissipative yet use Fourier series in only represent the steady-state solution
